	<h2> Elizabeth's <strong> Background </strong> </h2>
	<p> I grew up in southern California. I was homeschooled most of my life. I hated the lack of structure and lack of socialization. I was grateful to move onto college. When I was 19, I started working for Black and Decker. They paid for my undergraduate education in business. After 6 years of working for them, I went into educational sales. I worked for an art school as well as a psychology school. In 2011, I moved to Austin. It was in Austin I decided to become a massage therapist. I'm good at massage, but I also have a wide variety of interests. I have always believed in challenging myself to learn new things and to build a portfolio of skills. That's why I'm here learning how to code. I took <em> HTML </em> in the 90's, and I took a <em> Visual Basic </em> class with my mom in 2001. I finished half of an online <em>Python</em> course recently, which was rather boring and unmotivating. I like being in class where I can engage with students and instructors.
